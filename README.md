## Description
Fullstack Next.js e-commerce app.

## How To
After cloning the project, the first thing you have to do is recreate the files needed to be able to run the project. These files have been removed because they contain sensitive informations that you have to provide and that is specific to each person. After that, you can launch the app.

### Creating required files
* ``./.env.local`` with the following structure:
```s
# OAuth2 credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"

# Set when production
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://www.domain.example"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="YOUR_SECRET_STRING"

# Database for Prisma
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<DOMAIN>:<PORT>/<DATABASE_NAME>"
```
> Replace the placeholders by their real values depending on your project configuration (YOUR_SECRET_STRING can be anything, e.g. generated by this command ```openssl rand -base64 32```).

### Launching the Next.js app
From root folder execute this code snippet in a terminal:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
